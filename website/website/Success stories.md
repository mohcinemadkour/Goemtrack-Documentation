## Does GPS tracking pay for itself?

                                                              Yes it does, and in more ways than one. Eliminating just one hour of unnecessary                                 overtime                                 per month can pay for the service.

                                                              With improved efficiency, taking on that one extra job can be enough to shift your                                 bottom                                 line into the black. An accident avoided due to improved driving behavior can be worth                                 an                                 entire year of the service, recouping the outlay in an instant.
