Once exclusive to Spy Movies, compact GPS trackers are becoming a reality. What are engineers making with these smaller systems?A quick Amazon or Ebay search yields hundreds of results. So how do these GPS trackers work and why are they becoming more mainstream? _Basic overview of GPS tracker signals_

### Types: SD vs Cellular

GPS trackers can be broken down into two separate groups. The first type of GPS records location to internal memory. For example, below is a GPS tracker that saves the time and GPS location to an SD card.

These GPS trackers are often more compact than other types of GPS trackers, but the size reduction comes at the cost of an inability to view current data. To view the historical GPS data, the device needs to be removed from service and the contents of the SD card viewed. These devices are often also referred to as GPS Loggers. Below is a basic overview of how these systems can work.

The second type of GPS trackers relies on a cellular data connection. These GPS trackers operate very similar to SD card based trackers, but the Cellular modem replaces an SD card. These trackers transmit information at set increments or on-demand to a cloud service.

These GPS trackers requires an annual or monthly subscription for the use of the cellular data connection. The data from the cloud services is then available from a website or sometimes even an app.
